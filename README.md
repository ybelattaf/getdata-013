#Getting and cleaning data project project

##Description
This project contains an R script 'run_analysis.R' that performs some operations on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set in order to get a tidy data set:

	- Merge the training and test data sets
	- Extract certain columns (those that correspond to means and standard deviations)
	- Enhance the data set by adding understandable variables names and values
	- summarize the data set by grouping by subjects and activities
